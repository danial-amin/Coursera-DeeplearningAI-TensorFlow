Question 1
What is a Convolution?<br>
A technique to make images bigger<br>
<ins>**A technique to isolate features in images**<\ins><br>
A technique to filter out unwanted images<br>
A technique to make images smaller<br>

Question 2
What is a Pooling?<br>
A technique to make images sharper<br>
<ins>**A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features**<\ins><br>
A technique to isolate features in images<br>
A technique to combine pictures<br>

Question 3
How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
They make the image smaller
They make the image clearer
They make processing of images faster
**They isolate features in images**

Question 4
After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?
**26x26**
28x28
25x25
31x31

Question 5
After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?
56x56
28x28
**13x13**
26x26

Question 6
Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:
Slower
Stay the same
Faster
**It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!**
