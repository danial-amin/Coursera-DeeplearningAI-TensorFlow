Question 1<br>
What is a Convolution?<br>
A technique to make images bigger<br>
<ins>**A technique to isolate features in images**</ins><br>
A technique to filter out unwanted images<br>
A technique to make images smaller<br>

Question 2<br>
What is a Pooling?<br>
A technique to make images sharper<br>
<ins>**A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features**</ins><br>
A technique to isolate features in images<br>
A technique to combine pictures<br>

Question 3<br>
How do Convolutions improve image recognition?<br>
They make the image smaller<br>
They make the image clearer<br>
They make processing of images faster<br>
<ins>**They isolate features in images**</ins><br>

Question 4<br>
After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?<br>
<ins>**26x26**</ins><br>
28x28<br>
25x25<br>
31x31<br>

Question 5<br>
After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?<br>
56x56<br>
28x28<br>
<ins>**13x13**</ins><br>
26x26<br>

Question 6<br>
Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:<br>
Slower<br>
Stay the same<br>
Faster<br>
<ins>**It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!**</ins><br>
